Fraazo was launched in 2016 as a fresh produce store in the posh locality of Powai with a clear vision of serving the customers with farm-fresh groceries delivered at the doorstep.
Amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, while citizens are struggling to get delivery slots from bigger e-commerce players, Fraazo has successfully emerged as a trusted platform to provide farm-fresh vegetables and fruits across Mumbai and Pune with its express delivery (two hours) service by implementing rigorous safety and hygiene standards across the value chain. This consumer agri-tech startup is the retail brand of VnF, Mumbaiâ€™s leading player in the B2B perishables category providing farm-fresh vegetables and fruits.
